            Fun fact: all websites use HTML — even this one. It’s a fundamental

            that gives web pages structure, by using elements and tags, you can
            add text, images, videos, forms, and more. Learning HTML basics is
            an important first step in your web development journey and an
            essential skill for front- and back-end developers.
